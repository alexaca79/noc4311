## Goal: Build a model that forecasts the number of future police officers needed in Ontario (next 25 years) 
## Quantify:
How many police officers are needed for a growing population
How many minority officers needed to make the police force more equitable 
How many women officers needed to make the police force more equitable 

## Method:  Regression (Supervised learning) 
## Approach: Predict the Authorized police officer strength per 100,000 individuals and multiply that by future population forecasts provided by the Ministry of Finance  
## Data Used: 
Police officers by rank and gender, Canada, provinces and territories  - CANSIM 35-10-0078-01 
Population estimates on July 1st, by age and sex - CANSIM 17-10-0005-01
